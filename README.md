# CrossGL Demos Repository

Welcome to the official CrossGL Demos repository! This repository is your go-to resource for exploring practical examples of how to use the CrossGL Translator to write and deploy shaders across multiple graphics APIs effectively. Dive into our samples and see CrossGL in action!

## Overview

The CrossGL Demos repository is structured to provide you with a hands-on look at the capabilities of our CrossGL Translator. Each sample in the `samples` directory showcases different aspects and potential applications of CrossGL shader code (`cgl` files), demonstrating the power and flexibility of our universal shader language.

## Repository Structure

- **`/samples`**: This directory contains a curated list of CrossGL (`cgl`) shader code examples. Each sample is designed to illustrate how CrossGL can be used to achieve various effects and functionalities in graphics programming.

## How to Use the Samples

To get the most out of these samples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CrossGL/demos.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Samples Directory**: Change into the `samples` directory:
   ```bash
   cd demos/samples
   ```
3. **Explore Individual Samples**: Each file within the `samples` directory is a standalone example of CrossGL code. You can open these files in your preferred code editor to study and modify them.

## Learning from the Samples

Each sample is an opportunity to understand better:
- How CrossGL handles different shader functionalities.
- The syntax and structure of CrossGL shader code.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to the CrossGL Demos repository! If you have created a shader sample that you believe would benefit the community, please consider submitting it. To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your sample.
3. Add your sample to the `samples` directory.
4. Push your changes and submit a pull request.

Make sure to provide a brief explanation of your sample and how it contributes to demonstrating the use of CrossGL.
